GoodBo is a game similar to Skip-Bo, but better in that it depends much more on player strategy, rather than their luck.
The end goal is for GoodBo to be hosted on a website, ideally in a manner that allows for multiplayer sessions.
However, the first "release" of GoodBo is to be a terminal-based game, where players take turns at the screen and play.
I'll be working on this on and off, but I have little incentive to finish/work on this so the world may never know if/when this will be done.
