GoodBo is a game similar to Skip-Bo, but better in that it depends much more on player strategy, rather than their luck.
GoodBo is, at the time of writing, still a WIP; it has many bugs, and as of 2020-05-08, it is not fully functioning.
The end goal is for GoodBo to be hosted on a website, ideally in a manner that allows for multiplayer sessions.
However, the first "release" of GoodBo is planned to be a terminal-based game, where players take turns at the screen and play.
